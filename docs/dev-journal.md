## 2026-07-30 — 360 audit and full remediation

**Tool**: Claude Code (Opus 5)

Vendored the shared template system, audited the package against it, and
closed every finding. 33 findings, 14 tickets, 14 PRs.

**Changes**

- Vendored `solid-ai-templates` as a submodule at
  `docs/solid-ai-templates` (ADR-004), matching the path and URL used by
  `corrosim_repo` and `randomgen`.
- Ran a 360-degree audit and stored it at `docs/audits/2026-07-30-360.md`.
  Perspectives re-projected per the template's headless rule. Overall
  grade C-, weakest dimension Correctness.
- Fixed every finding. The three that mattered: detection predicates that
  discarded real pages, a CLI that could not signal failure, and a reaper
  that killed browsers it had not launched.
- Added the standard documents — `CLAUDE.md` (hybrid model),
  `ONBOARDING.md`, `PLAYBOOK.md`, and this file.
- CI grew a Windows leg; the coverage floor ratcheted 63 → 70 → 76 against
  ~79% measured. `__main__.py` 39% → 99%, `chrome.py` 72% → 100%,
  `fake.py` → 100%. Suite 178 → 299 tests, and faster than it started.

**PRs merged**: #26 through #39 (fourteen)

**Issues created and closed**: #12 through #25

**Decisions**

- *Ambiguous detection phrases are size-gated rather than dropped.* "No
  longer available" and "has been discontinued" are genuine soft-404
  markers on a stub and ordinary body copy on a real product page. Deleting
  them would lose real soft-404 detection; keeping them unanchored was
  losing real pages. They now count only below `MIN_REAL_CONTENT_BYTES`.
- *Batch failure exits 2, not 1.* "Some pages are missing" and "nothing
  came back" call for different handling in a pipeline, and collapsing them
  would force the caller to count output files to tell them apart.
- *Chrome ownership is decided by process ancestry, not PID sampling.*
  Two `tasklist` samples cannot establish that a PID belongs to this
  process. Where ancestry cannot be established, nothing is tracked —
  leaving a browser behind is a nuisance, killing someone's tabs is not.
- *`use_cache=False` stays a refresh, not a bypass.* The audit called the
  write a defect; it is deliberate and was already pinned by a test. The
  README's "bypass cache" wording was what was wrong.
- *Dependency floors were raised anyway.* `increase-if-necessary` is now
  the Dependabot strategy, but the pending bumps were taken first at the
  maintainer's direction, against the recommendation to close them. The
  `browsers` extra and `setuptools` floors now exceed what the code needs.

**Learned**

- *A test suite must not touch the host.* `pytest` killed a real Chrome
  process on the development machine: no test launches a browser, but
  `_start_nodriver_session` sampled the live process list for real even
  behind a fake engine. A conftest fixture now stubs both queries. This is
  what raised #21 from P2 to P0 mid-session.
- *Read the tests before calling something a bug.* Audit finding C5 was
  wrong — the behaviour it flagged was documented in a test written
  precisely to stop a future tidy-up from changing it. The change was made
  anyway and that test caught it.
- *`gh pr merge --delete-branch` closes stacked PRs* pointing at the
  deleted branch rather than retargeting them. Recovery: recreate the ref,
  reopen, retarget. Recorded in CLAUDE.md 2.1. The same class of mistake
  cost Dependabot PR #7, which closed itself when `dependabot.yml` changed
  in an earlier-merged PR.
- *ruff walks the filesystem, not the git index*, so a submodule is linted
  even when untracked here. CI never saw it — `actions/checkout` does not
  fetch submodules by default — so only the documented local gate broke.
- *Linux and Windows cover different branches of `chrome.py`*, so the
  coverage floor has to track the lowest matrix leg rather than any single
  measurement.

**Cross-repo: the PerimeterX spike**

Checked `Imbra-Ltd/wuseria` for tickets this package inherited. Only
wuseria#865 is PerimeterX and it had already been carried over as #9 — but
the carry-over took the body only. Six of its seven comments were left
behind, including a screenshot of the Press & Hold challenge that existed
nowhere else. Archived onto #9 verbatim with original authors and
timestamps. #9 was also missing a priority label; wuseria#865 had P4, so
the `P4` label was created here and applied.

Also retested wuseria#556, which lists ePHOTOzine, Digital Camera World
and CineD as sites that block automated fetches and proposes five manual
workarounds. All three now fetch on tier 1 — plain urllib, ~1s each, no
browser, 15/15 content markers present including the lab figures the issue
depends on. Reported there rather than transferring the issue: it is
scoped to a human workflow and to wuseria's PLAYBOOK, not to this package.
The retest is three articles from one residential IP and does not settle
the batch case.

**Not done**

- #9 (PerimeterX spike) remains open; it predates the audit and none of
  its acceptance criteria were attempted. The cheapest one — testing
  whether challenge frequency tracks request velocity — is still the
  right next step.
- wuseria#556 left open pending a retest against the real scoring batch.
- ADR-002's coverage rationale is still accurate, but the floor has moved
  three times since it was written.
- `--js --uc --nodriver` together resolves to UC. That was undefined by
  test before #36 and is now pinned as-is; whether it should instead be
  an error is an open question, not a decision.

## 2026-07-26 — Standalone repository and the toolchain

**Changes**

- Extracted the package from `Imbra-Ltd/wuseria`, where it had grown as
  `tools/pagefetch/`, into this repository (ADR-001).
- Added the Python toolchain and the three-layer gate: editor, pre-commit,
  CI (ADR-002). Coverage floor set to 45 against the measured baseline.
- Fixed `Content-Encoding` handling in the urllib tier — the tier asked for
  gzip and deflate without decoding them.
- Allowlisted `http` and `https` at every entry point (ADR-003). `urllib`
  would otherwise read `file://` URLs and return them as page content. The
  ADR records why blocking private address ranges is deliberately out of
  scope: it would break ordinary intranet and localhost fetching while
  offering a guarantee this layer cannot honestly make.
- Extracted the batch session lifecycle into `_BatchSession` and brought it
  under test; coverage floor raised 45 → 63.

**PRs merged**: #5, #8, #10, #11

## 2026-05-20 to 2026-05-30 — Upstream history

The package grew inside `Imbra-Ltd/wuseria` before this repository existed.
Summarized here because the commits are not in this history; the README's
"Performance history" section carries the per-version detail.

- Three-tier engine (urllib, Playwright, UC), then Nodriver added as tier 3
  via CDP, which cut a three-page bot-protected batch from 27s to 16s.
- Refactored from a single 748-line script into a package with a
  `PageSource` ABC, `NetworkFetcher` and `FakeFetcher`.
- Cache correctness work across several sessions: throttle pages stopped
  poisoning the cache, 404/gone bodies became terminal and self-healing,
  passive delete on read plus `--clean-cache`, and the cache directory
  unified behind `PAGEFETCH_CACHE_DIR` with a `--cache-dir` flag.
- Tightened the Cloudflare "checking your browser" pattern after it
  false-matched ad-blocker help text on a real DPReview page — the same
  class of defect the 2026-07-30 session found twice more.

Two decision records from that period still cover this package:
[ADR-035](https://github.com/Imbra-Ltd/wuseria/blob/main/docs/decisions/035-pagefetch-package-and-brandkit.md)
on the extraction and the standard-library-only contract, and
[ADR-037](https://github.com/Imbra-Ltd/wuseria/blob/main/docs/decisions/037-pagefetch-cache-validity-no-ttl.md)
on content-based cache validity.
