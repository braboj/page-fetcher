"""Filesystem cache for fetched pages.

Caches responses on disk keyed by a hash of the URL, so repeated fetches
of the same page during a session are free. The cache directory is a
constructor parameter (not a module global) so the package stays portable:
a consuming project points it wherever it likes; the default is relative
to the current working directory.

The key scheme (sha256(url) truncated to 16 hex chars, plus a .txt/.html
suffix) is fixed — changing it would silently invalidate every existing
cached file.
